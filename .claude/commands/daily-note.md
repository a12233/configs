Compact and update today's daily note file.

1. Read today's note at `~/notes/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md`
2. If it doesn't exist, create it with a `# YYYY-MM-DD` header
3. Review the current conversation and extract key items:
   - Setup changes and configurations made
   - Commands and tools installed
   - Important decisions or solutions found
   - Useful shortcuts or aliases created
4. Add new items to appropriate sections (create sections if needed)
5. Remove duplicates and consolidate related items
6. Keep notes concise but informative

Do not ask for confirmation - just update the file and show a summary of changes made.
